# Gradient Messenger for Chrome


A Chrome extension that I made that allows for using gradients for the messenger website.


## Features:

1. Allows for CSS gradients to be used on the *client* side.
2. Allows the user to create custom CSS gradient on the fly and apply on the page.
3. It already has some cool presets built-in to it, to test out the functionality.



**NOTE:** this only works for the client side, so it only displays on **YOUR** **device** and not the person that you're talking with, *although* they can install the extension so that they can use it as well!
